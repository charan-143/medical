Mr Krishna
Verified byGlucose - Fasting
Method: Hexokinase173 mg/dL 70-100
Criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes    
a) Fasting Plasma Glucose =126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L).>    
or    
b) Hemoglobin A1C =6.5% (48 mmol/mol).>     
or    
c) In a patient with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis, a random plasma glucose =200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L).>
Note:     
*In the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, diagnosis requires two abnormal test results from the same sample or in two  separate    
 test samples     
Criteria defining prediabetes*    
a) Fasting Plasma Glucose 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) to 125 mg/dL (6.9 mmol/L) (IFG).  
or    
b) Hemoglobin A1C 5.7 6.4% (39 47 mmol/mol). – –  
Note:     
*For all three tests, risk is continuous, extending below the lower limit of the range and becoming disproportionately greater at the
higher end of the range.
